    While Solving Task 'b' in CG Assignment, I applied some changes in 'a'
        - Added Screenshots for the two tasks.
        - Added little documentation(Name and color of the shape).
        - Changed the way of scaling from using a scaler value for each x and y value to      glScalef(oldScaleX.0f * 2.0, oldScaleY.0f * 2.0)
